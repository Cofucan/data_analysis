# My Data Analysis Portfolio Projects

Just a couple of data analysis projects. Datasets gotten from different sourses (linked in each folder). There is a readme in each project folder where I describe my findings and tell my story.

I follow a process for each project:
1. Ask a few questions
2. Gather data for analysis
3. Clean, filter and querry the data using different tools including Microsoft SQL, Excel, Power Bi, Tableau and Python.

- I use Tableau because it is common in most companies and it can handle laege datasets better than Power Bi. It also free online hosting for dashboards for easy sharing. One limitation I have with Tableau is that the free version dosen't allow direct SQL integration. I have to convert my queries to Excel before importing to Tableau.
- I use Power Bi also because it is industry standard, but also because the free version allows for direct SQL integration. I can just select the datasets(s) (usually an Excel file) and insert my SQL code and then import the cleaned data directly. 

For each project, I spend some time to study the dataset(s) and find patterns and answers to questions.

Everything here is a work in progress.
