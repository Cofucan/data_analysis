# Project 1 - [Sales Record Analysis]

The dataset was downloaded as a sample dataset from docs.microsoft.com in the Power Bi learning section.

The data contains fictional sales records of 6 differnet products sold in multiple countries from the period of September 2013 to December 2014.

## Software Tools Used
I analyze the data with multiple softare tools (files included in the project folder).
### Excel
Since this is a relatively small dataset (700 rows), it can be easily analyzed with Excel. I created a new sheet and adjusted some parameters and fields on the table to ease my querying when imported to SQL and Power Bi.
I also use Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to answer the questions.
### SQL 
I import the Excel file to SQL and write a bunch of queries to easily filter, sort and analyze the data.
### Power Bi
I bring the raw data to Power Bi and use Power Query to adjust the table like I did with Excel. I create vizualizations/charts and try to justify my answers to the questions.
### Tableau
I also use Tableau to do the same vizualizations as I did with Power Bi.

## Questions
---
After studying the data, I've come up with questions which can be answered by analyzing the data;
1. How do the discounts affect sales figures for each product?
2. What are the profit margins for each product, relative to discounts?
3. What discount level produced the highest profit margins from the whole data?
4. Which months were more profitable than others?
