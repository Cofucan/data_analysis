# Project 1 [Sales Data Sample]

The dataset was downloaded as a sample dataset from docs.microsoft.com in the Power Bi learning section.
This is a large dataset with 6 tables; Sales, Date, Product, Geography, Manufacturer and Sentiment.

## A. Questions
So far...

## B. Quick Summary

## C. Dataset Limitations

## D. Software Tools Used
I analyze the data with multiple softare tools (files included in the project folder).
### Excel
This is a relatively large dataset with multiple tables (one table contains over 2 million rows), so I don't bother to analyze it with Excel. I could use Power Query addin but since its also in Power Bi, I descide to just use Power Bi directly.
### SQL 
The original data file was a Microsoft Access file so I import it to SQL with all 6 tables.
### Power Bi
After writing all the queries to analyze the data and answer my questions, I bring the data to Power Bi to tell the story with vizualizations and dashboards.
### Tableau
I also use Tableau to do the same vizualizations as I did with Power Bi.
