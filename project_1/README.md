# Project 1 - [Sales Record Analysis]

The dataset was downloaded as a sample dataset from docs.microsoft.com in the Power Bi learning section.

The data contains fictional sales records of 6 differnet products sold in multiple countries from the period of September 2013 to December 2014.

## Questions
---
After studying the data, I've come up with 2 major questions which can be answered by analyzing the data;
1. How do the discounts affect sales figures for each product?
2. What are the profit margins for each product, relative to discounts?
3. What discount level produced the highest profit margins from the whole data?
